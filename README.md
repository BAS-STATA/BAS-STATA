- 👋 Hi, I’m @BAS-STATA
- 👀 I’m interested in developing Stata code for medical researchers, , especially those working with clinical trials.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to write efficient code that is flexible, provides good audit trail, and provides prompts and instructions to improve quality of work.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on specific code for tasks such as DMEC reports.
